# Gender and Age Detection using Deep Learning
The goal of this project is to build a deep learning model that can predict a person's gender (male or female) and estimate their age using the UTK dataset. The UTK dataset is a large-scale face dataset with over 20,000 annotated images, containing images of people from various age groups and genders.

The proposed architecture for gender and age detection utilizes a CNN-based model. It consists of multiple convolutional layers with increasing depth, followed by batch normalization and max-pooling layers to extract relevant features from facial images. The extracted features are then flattened and passed through fully connected layers with rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation. The final layers include dropout regularization to prevent overfitting and two separate output layers for gender and age prediction.
