# Gender and Age Detection using Deep Learning
The goal of this project is to build a deep learning model that can predict a person's gender (male or female) and estimate their age using the UTK dataset. The UTK dataset is a large-scale face dataset with over 20,000 annotated images, containing images of people from various age groups and genders.
